abstract = {For the last decade, it has been shown that neuroimaging can be a potential tool for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and also fusion of different modalities can further provide the complementary information to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Here, we focus on the problems of both feature representation and fusion of multimodal information from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). To our best knowledge, the previous methods in the literature mostly used hand-crafted features such as cortical thickness, gray matter densities from MRI, or voxel intensities from PET, and then combined these multimodal features by simply concatenating into a long vector or transforming into a higher-dimensional kernel space. In this paper, we propose a novel method for a high-level latent and shared feature representation from neuroimaging modalities via deep learning. Specifically, we use Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM).22Although it is clear from the context that the acronym DBM denotes "Deep Boltzmann Machine" in this paper, we would clearly indicate that DBM here is not related to "Deformation Based Morphometry"., a deep network with a restricted Boltzmann machine as a building block, to find a latent hierarchical feature representation from a 3D patch, and then devise a systematic method for a joint feature representation from the paired patches of MRI and PET with a multimodal DBM. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we performed experiments on ADNI dataset and compared with the state-of-the-art methods. In three binary classification problems of AD vs. healthy Normal Control (NC), MCI vs. NC, and MCI converter vs. MCI non-converter, we obtained the maximal accuracies of 95.35{\%}, 85.67{\%}, and 74.58{\%}, respectively, outperforming the competing methods. By visual inspection of the trained model, we observed that the proposed method could hierarchically discover the complex latent patterns inherent in both MRI and PET.},

abstract = {This paper investigates how to integrate the complementary information from RGB and thermal (RGB-T) sources for object tracking. We propose a novel Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) architecture, including a two-stream ConvNet and a FusionNet, to achieve adaptive fusion of different source data for robust RGB-T tracking. Both RGB and thermal streams extract generic semantic information of the target object. In particular, the thermal stream is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset to encode rich semantic information, and then fine-tuned using thermal images to capture the specific properties of thermal information. For adaptive fusion of different modalities while avoiding redundant noises, the FusionNet is employed to select most discriminative feature maps from the outputs of the two-stream ConvNet, and updated online to adapt to appearance variations of the target object. Finally, the object locations are efficiently predicted by applying the multi-channel correlation filter on the fused feature maps. Extensive experiments on the recently public benchmark GTOT verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach against other state-of-the-art RGB-T trackers.},

abstract = {Sea–land segmentation and ship detection are two prevalent research domains for optical remote sensing harbor images and can find many applications in harbor supervision and management. As the spatial resolution of imaging technology improves, traditional methods struggle to perform well due to the complicated appearance and background distributions. In this paper, we unify the above two tasks into a single framework and apply the deep convolutional neural networks to predict pixelwise label for an input. Specifically, an edge aware convolutional network is proposed to parse a remote sensing harbor image into three typical objects, e.g., sea, land, and ship. Two innovations are made on top of the deep structure. First, we design a multitask model by simultaneously training the segmentation and edge detection networks. Hierarchical semantic features from the segmentation network are extracted to learn the edge network. Second, the outputs of edge pipeline are further employed to refine entire model by adding an edge aware regularization, which helps our method to yield very desirable results that are spatially consistent and well boundary located. It also benefits the segmentation of docked ships that are quite challenging for many previous methods. Experimental results on two datasets collected from Google Earth have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach both in quantitative and qualitative performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Our experience of the world is multimodal - we see objects, hear sounds, feel texture, smell odors, and taste flavors. Modality refers to the way in which something happens or is experienced and a research problem is characterized as multimodal when it includes multiple such modalities. In order for Artificial Intelligence to make progress in understanding the world around us, it needs to be able to interpret such multimodal signals together. Multimodal machine learning aims to build models that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. It is a vibrant multi-disciplinary field of increasing importance and with extraordinary potential. Instead of focusing on specific multimodal applications, this paper surveys the recent advances in multimodal machine learning itself and presents them in a common taxonomy. We go beyond the typical early and late fusion categorization and identify broader challenges that are faced by multimodal machine learning, namely: representation, translation, alignment, fusion, and co-learning. This new taxonomy will enable researchers to better understand the state of the field and identify directions for future research.},

abstract = {Deep networks have shown impressive performance on many computer vision tasks. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used to learn discrim-inative texture representations. One of the most successful approaches is Bilinear CNN model that explicitly captures the second order statistics within deep features. However, these networks cut off the first order information flow in the deep network and make gradient back-propagation dif-ficult. We propose an effective fusion architecture -FASON that combines second order information flow and first or-der information flow. Our method allows gradients to back-propagate through both flows freely and can be trained ef-fectively. We then build a multi-level deep architecture to exploit the first and second order information within dif-ferent convolutional layers.

abstract = {Face recognition finds its place in a large number of applications. They occur in different contexts related to security, entertainment or Internet applications. Reliable face recognition is still a great challenge to computer vision and pattern recognition researchers, and new algorithms need to be evaluated on relevant databases. The publicly available IV2 database allows monomodal and multimodal experiments using face data. Known variabilities, that are critical for the performance of the biometric systems (such as pose, expression, illumination and quality) are present. The face and subface data that are acquired in this database are: 2D audio-video talking-face sequences, 2D stereoscopic data acquired with two pairs of synchronized cameras, 3D facial data acquired with a laser scanner, and iris images acquired with a portable infrared camera. The IV2 database is designed for monomodal and multimodal experiments. The quality of the acquired data is of great importance. Therefore as a first step, and in order to better evaluate the quality of the data, a first internal evaluation was conducted. Only a small amount of the total acquired data was used for this evaluation: 2D still images, 3D scans and iris images. First results show the interest of this database. In parallel to the research algorithms, open-source reference systems were also run for baseline comparisons.},

It is comprised of more than 600 individuals acquired simultaneously in three scenarios: 1) over the Internet, 2) in an office environment with desktop PC, and 3) in indoor/outdoor environments with mobile portable hardware. The three scenarios include a common part of audio/video data. Also, signature and fingerprint data have been acquired both with desktop PC and mobile portable hardware. Additionally, hand and iris data were acquired in the second scenario using desktop PC. Acquisition has been conducted by 11 European institutions. Additional features of the BioSecure Multimodal Database (BMDB) are: two acquisition sessions, several sensors in certain modalities, balanced gender and age distributions, multimodal realistic scenarios with simple and quick tasks per modality, cross-European diversity, availability of demographic data, and compatibility with other multimodal databases. The novel acquisition conditions of the BMDB allow us to perform new challenging research and evaluation of either monomodal or multimodal biometric systems, as in the recent BioSecure Multimodal Evaluation campaign. A description of this campaign including baseline results of individual modalities from the new database is also given.

Two biometric characteristics are considered in this study: iris and fingerprint. Multimodal biometric system needs an effective fusion scheme to combine biometric characteristics derived from one or more modalities. The score level fusion is used to combine the characteristics from diff erent biometric modalities. Fusion at the score level is a new technique, which has a high potential for e f ficient consolidation of multiple unimodal biometric matcher outputs. Support vector machine and extreme learning techniques are used in this system for recognition of biometric traits. In this, the Fingerprint-Iris system provides better performance and comparison of support vector machine and extreme learning machine based on score-level fusion methods is obtained In score-level fusion, ELM provides better performance as compare to the SVM It reduces the classification time of current system. This work is valuable and makes an e f ficient accuracy in such applications. This system can be utilized for person identification in several applications.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art methods for 3D hand pose estimation from depth images require large amounts of annotated training data. We propose to model the statistical relationships of 3D hand poses and corresponding depth images using two deep generative models with a shared latent space. By design, our architecture allows for learning from unlabeled image data in a semi-supervised manner. Assuming a one-to-one mapping between a pose and a depth map, any given point in the shared latent space can be projected into both a hand pose and a corresponding depth map. Regressing the hand pose can then be done by learning a discriminator to estimate the posterior of the latent pose given some depth map. To improve generalization and to better exploit unlabeled depth maps, we jointly train a generator and a discriminator. At each iteration, the generator is updated with the back-propagated gradient from the discriminator to synthesize realistic depth maps of the articulated hand, while the discriminator benefits from an augmented training set of synthesized and unlabeled samples. The proposed discriminator network architecture is highly efficient and runs at 90 FPS on the CPU with accuracies comparable or better than state-of-art on 3 publicly available benchmarks.},

abstract = {Multimodal classification arises in many computer vi-sion tasks such as object classification and image retrieval. The idea is to utilize multiple sources (modalities) measur-ing the same instance to improve the overall performance compared to using a single source (modality). The varying characteristics exhibited by multiple modalities make it nec-essary to simultaneously learn the corresponding distance metrics. In this paper, we propose a multiple metrics learn-ing algorithm for multimodal data. Metric of each modal-ity is product of two matrices: one matrix is modality spe-cific, the other is enforced to be shared by all the modalities. The learned metrics can improve multimodal classification accuracy and experimental results on four datasets show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing learning algorithms based on multiple metrics as well as other ap-proaches tested on these datasets. Specifically, we report 95.0{\%} object instance recognition accuracy, 89.2{\%} object category recognition accuracy on the multi-view RGB-D dataset and 52.3{\%} scene category recognition accuracy on SUN RGB-D dataset.},

In the Portal Challenge Problem, the goal is to recognize people from near-infrared (NIR) and high definition (HD) video as they walk through a portal. Iris recognition can be performed from the NIR video and face recognition from the HD video. The availability of NIR and HD modalities allows for the development of fusion algorithms. The Still Face Challenge Problem has two primary goals. The first is to improve recognition performance from frontal and off angle still face images taken under uncontrolled in- door and outdoor lighting. The second is to improve recognition perfor- mance on still frontal face images that have been resized and compressed, as is required for electronic passports. In the Video Challenge Problem, the goal is to recognize people from video in unconstrained environments. The video is unconstrained in pose, illumination, and camera angle. All three challenge problems include a large data set, experiment descrip- tions, ground truth, and scoring code.},

abstract = {Multimodal biometrie systems seek to alleviate some of the limitations of unimodal biometrie systems by combining multiple pieces of evidence of the same person in the deeision-making process. In this paper, a novel multimodal biometric identification system is proposed based on fusing the results obtained from both the face and the left and right irises using deep learning approaches. Firstly, the facial features are extracted using a Deep Belief Network (DBN) architecture consisting of 3-layers. The first two RBMs are used as features detectors, while the last one is used as a discriminative model associated with softmax units for the multi-class classification purpose. Secondly, an efficient deep learning system is employed for iris recognition, whose architecture is based on a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Softmax classifier to extract discriminative features from an iris image. Extensive experiments on large-scale challenging databases, including FERET, CASIA V1.0 and MMU1, and SDUMLA-HMT have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed approaches by achieving new state-of-the-art Rank-1 identification rates on all the employed databases.},

abstract = {The MBioID initiative has been set up to address the following germane question: What and how biometric technologies could be deployed in identity documents in the foreseeable future? This research effort proposes to look at current and future practices and systems of establishing and using biometric identity documents (IDs) and evaluate their effectiveness in large-scale developments. The first objective of the MBioID project is to present a review document establishing the current state-of-the-art related to the use of multimodal biometrics in an IDs application. This research report gives the main definitions, properties and the framework of use related to biometrics, an overview of the main standards developed in the biometric industry and standardisation organisations to ensure interoperability, as well as some of the legal framework and the issues associated to biometrics such as privacy and personal data protection. The state-of-the-art in terms of technological development is also summarised for a range of single biometric modalities (2D and 3D face, fingerprint, iris, on-line signature and speech), chosen according to ICAO recommendations and availabilities, and for various multimodal approaches. This paper gives a summary of the main elements of that report. The second objective of the MBioID project is to propose relevant acquisition and evaluation protocols for a large-scale deployment of biometric IDs. Combined with the protocols, a multimodal database will be acquired in a realistic way, in order to be as close as possible to a real biometric IDs deployment. In this paper, the issues and solutions related to the acquisition setup are briefly presented. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Person re-identification (ReID) is an important task in video surveillance and has various applications. It is non-trivial due to complex background clutters, varying illu-mination conditions, and uncontrollable camera settings. Moreover, the person body misalignment caused by detec-tors or pose variations is sometimes too severe for feature matching across images. In this study, we propose a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), called Spindle Net, based on human body region guided multi-stage feature de-composition and tree-structured competitive feature fusion. It is the first time human body structure information is con-sidered in a CNN framework to facilitate feature learning. The proposed Spindle Net brings unique advantages: 1) it separately captures semantic features from different body regions thus the macro-and micro-body features can be well aligned across images, 2) the learned region features from different semantic regions are merged with a competitive scheme and discriminative features can be well preserved. State of the art performance can be achieved on multiple datasets by large margins. We further demonstrate the ro-bustness and effectiveness of the proposed Spindle Net on our proposed dataset SenseReID without fine-tuning.},

abstract = {—Authentication based on vein patterns is a very promising biometric technique. The most important step is the accurate extraction of the vein pattern from sometimes low quality input images. A single feature extraction technique may fail to correctly extract the vein pattern, entailing bad recognition performance. One of the solutions that can be used to improve recognition results is biometric fusion. A possible fusion strategy is feature level fusion, that is the fusion of several feature extractors' outputs. In our work, we exploited the feature level fusion to improve the quality of the extracted vein patterns and thus the feature extraction accuracy. An experimental study involving different feature extraction techniques (maximum curvature, repeated line tracking, wide line detector, ...) and different fusion techniques (majority voting, weighted average, STAPLE, ...) is conducted on the UTFVP finger-vein data set. The results show that feature level fusion is able to improve the recognition accuracy in terms of the EER over the single feature extraction techniques.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on indoor semantic segmentation us-ing RGB-D data. Although the commonly used deconvolu-tion networks (DeconvNet) have achieved impressive results on this task, we find there is still room for improvements in two aspects. One is about the boundary segmentation. DeconvNet aggregates large context to predict the label of each pixel, inherently limiting the segmentation precision of object boundaries. The other is about RGB-D fusion. Re-cent state-of-the-art methods generally fuse RGB and depth networks with equal-weight score fusion, regardless of the varying contributions of the two modalities on delineating different categories in different scenes. To address the two problems, we first propose a locality-sensitive DeconvNet (LS-DeconvNet) to refine the boundary segmentation over each modality. LS-DeconvNet incorporates locally visual and geometric cues from the raw RGB-D data into each DeconvNet, which is able to learn to upsample the coarse convolutional maps with large context whilst recovering sharp object boundaries. Towards RGB-D fusion, we introduce a gated fusion layer to effectively combine the two LS-DeconvNets. This layer can learn to adjust the contributions of RGB and depth over each pixel for high-performance object recognition. Experiments on the large-scale SUN RGB-D dataset and the popular NYU-Depth v2 dataset show that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art results for RGB-D indoor semantic segmentation.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Next, the obtained images of finger knuckle were subjected to image processing method in order to extract the knuckle furrows from them. The verification of person was performed by comparing the furrows on the verified and the reference knuckle images. To determine the similarity between the furrows we used the least-square contour alignment method. The usability of the proposed approach was tested experimentally. Practical experiments, conducted with our database, confirmed that results obtained are promising.},
