\chapter{Background Research}
\label{cha:Research}
To get an overview of which solutions already exist, research work has been carried out. This includes research of both face and iris recognition techniques but also existing solutions for information fusion, and is presented in this chapter, in the following sections.
\input{chapters/research/face_recognition.tex}
\input{chapters/research/Iris_Recognition.tex}
\input{chapters/research/Information_Fusion.tex}

Based on the knowledge gained from the research done, a set of requirements regarding the development of a solution are constructed. This is done to measure the quality of the solution.
