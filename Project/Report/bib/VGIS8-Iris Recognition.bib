abstract = {Iris recognition systems are a mature technology that is widely used throughout the world. In identification (as opposed to verification) mode, an iris to be recognized is typically matched against all N enrolled irises. This is the classic "1-to-N search". In order to improve the speed of large-scale identification, a modified "1-to-First" search has been used in some operational systems. A 1-to-First search terminates with the first below-threshold match that is found, whereas a 1-to-N search always finds the best match across all enrollments. We know of no previous studies that evaluate how the accuracy of 1-to-First search differs from that of 1-to-N search. Using a dataset of over 50,000 iris images from 2,800 different irises, we perform experiments to evaluate the relative accuracy of 1-to-First and 1-to-N search. We evaluate how the accuracy difference changes with larger numbers of enrolled irises, and with larger ranges of rotational difference allowed between iris images. We find that False Match error rate for 1-to-First is higher than for 1-to-N, and the the difference grows with larger number of enrolled irises and with larger range of rotation.},
annote = {The way that iris recognition works is that some kind of filter is applied to localize the iris. 2D Gador filter is often cited. Then that iris is checked against the whole database. This is called 1:N. They check the Hamming Distance between of the bits of the data and then choose the lowest ones as a pair. In 1:First search they do the same except there is is a threshold that that is has to be under to be accepted. If it is under that threshold it is accepted and the search is stopped. Two types of error can occour: a False Match (FM) and False Non-Match (FNM). A false match occurs when two samples from different individuals are declared by the system as a match. A false non-match is when two samples from the same individual fail to be considered as a match by the system},

abstract = {The iris recognition on a mobile phone is different from the conventional iris recognition implemented on a dedicated device in that the computational power of a mobile phone and the space for placing NIR (near infrared) LED (light emitting diode) illuminators and iris camera are limited. This paper raises these issues in detail based on real implementation of an iris recognition system in a mobile phone and proposes some solutions to these issues. An experimental study was conducted to search for the relevant power and wavelength of NIR LED illuminators with their positioning on a phone for capturing a good quality iris image. Subsequently, in view of the disparity between the user's gazing point and the center of the iris camera which causes degradation of acquired iris images, an experiment was performed to locate the appropriate gazing point for good iris image capture. A fast eye detection algorithm was proposed for implementation under the mobile platform with low computational facility. The experiments were conducted on a currently released mobile phone and the results showed promising potential for adoption of iris recognition as a reliable authentication means. As a result, two 850 nm LEDs were selected for iris illumination at 1.1 cm away from the iris camera for the size of a 7 cm × 13.7 cm phone. In the performance, the recognition accuracy was 0.1{\%} EER (equal error rate) and the eye detection rate with the speed of 17.64 ms on a mobile phone was 99.4{\%}.},

abstract = {The increasing popularity of smartphones amongst the population laid the basis for a wide range of applications aimed at security and privacy protection. Very modern mobile devices have recently demonstrated the feasibility of using a camera sensor to access the system without typing any alphanumerical password. In this work, we present a method that implements iris recognition in the visible spectrum through unsupervised learning by means of Self Organizing Maps (SOM). The proposed method uses a SOM network to cluster iris features at pixel level. The discriminative feature map is obtained by using RGB data of the iris combined with the statistical descriptors of kurtosis and skewness. An experimental analysis on MICHE-I and UBIRISv1 datasets demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithm, which has been specifically designed to require low processing power in compliance with the limited capability of common mobile devices.},

abstract = {Ocular biometrics encompasses the imaging and use of characteristic features extracted from the eyes for personal recognition. Ocular biometric modalities in visible light have mainly focused on iris, blood vessel structures over the white of the eye (mostly due to conjunctival and episcleral layers), and periocular region around eye. Most of the existing studies on iris recognition use the near infrared spectrum. However, conjunctival vasculature and periocular regions are imaged in the visible spectrum. Iris recognition in the visible spectrum is possible for light color irides or by utilizing special illumination. Ocular recognition in the visible spectrum is an important research area due to factors such as recognition at a distance, suitability for recognition with regular RGB cameras, and adaptability to mobile devices. Further these ocular modalities can be obtained from a single RGB eye image, and then fused together for enhanced performance of the system. Despite these advantages, the state-of-the-art related to ocular biometrics in visible spectrum is not well known. This paper surveys this topic in terms of computational image enhancement, feature extraction, classification schemes and designed hardware-based acquisition set-ups. Future research directions are also enumerated to identify the path forward.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. An error-correcting code (ECC) is a process of adding redundant data to a message, such that it can be recovered by a receiver even if a number of errors are introduced in transmission. Inspired by the principles of ECC, we introduce a method capable of detecting degraded features in biometric signatures by exploiting feature correlation. The main novelty is that, unlike existing biometric cryptosystems, the proposed method works directly on the biometric signature. Our approach performs a redundancy analysis of non-degraded data to build an undirected graphical model (Markov Random Field), whose energy minimization determines the sequence of degraded components of the biometric sample. Experiments carried out in different biometric traits ascertain the improvements attained when disregarding degraded features during the matching phase. Also, we stress that the proposed method is general enough to work in different classification methods, such as CNNs.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Finding the accurate position of an eye is crucial for mobile iris recognition system in order to extract the iris region quickly and correctly. Unfortunately, this is very difficult to accomplish when a person is wearing eyeglasses because of the interference from the eyeglasses. This paper proposes an eye detection method that is robust to eyeglass interference in mobile environment. The proposed method comprises two stages: eye candidate generation and eye validation. In the eye candidate generation stage, multi-scale window masks consisting of 2 × 3 subblocks are used to generate all image blocks possibly containing an eye image. In the ensuing eye validation stage, two methods are employed to determine which blocks actually contain true eye images and locate their precise positions as well: the first method searches for the glint of an NIR illuminator on the pupil region. If this first method fails, the next method computes the intensity difference between the assumed pupil and its surrounding region using multi-scale 3 × 3 window masks. Experimental results show that the proposed method detects the eye position more accurately and quickly than competing methods in the presence of interference from eyeglass frames.},

abstract = {This chapter explains the iris recognition algorithms and presents results of 9.1 million comparisons among eye images from trials in Britain, the USA, Japan, and Korea. The key to iris recognition is the failure of a test of statistical independence, which involves so many degrees-of-freedom that this test is virtually guaranteed to be passed whenever the phase codes for two different eyes are compared, but to be uniquely failed when any eye's phase code is compared with another version of itself. The test of statistical independence is implemented by the simple Boolean Exclusive-OR operator (XOR) applied to the 2048 bit phase vectors that encode any two iris patterns, masked (AND'ed) by both of their corresponding mask bit vectors to prevent non iris artifacts from influencing iris comparisons. The XOR operator detects disagreement between any corresponding pair of bits, while the AND operator ensures that the compared bits are both deemed to have been uncorrupted by eyelashes, eyelids, specular reflections, or other noise. The norms of the resultant bit vector and of theAND'ed mask vectors are then measured in order to compute a fractional Hamming Distance as the measure of the dissimilarity between any two irises, whose two phase code bit vectors are denoted {\{}. codeA, codeB{\}} and whose mask bit vectors are denoted {\{}. maskA, maskB{\}}. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {With the increasing imaging and processing capabilities of today's mobile devices, user authentication using iris biometrics has become feasible. However, as the acquisition conditions become more unconstrained and as image quality is typically lower than dedicated iris acquisition systems, the accurate segmentation of iris regions is crucial for these devices. In this work, an end to end Fully Convolutional Deep Neural Network (FCDNN) design is proposed to perform the iris segmentation task for lower-quality iris images. The network design process is explained in detail, and the resulting network is trained and tuned using several large public iris datasets. A set of methods to generate and augment suitable lower quality iris images from the high-quality public databases are provided. The network is trained on Near InfraRed (NIR) images initially and later tuned on additional datasets derived from visible images. Comprehensive inter-database comparisons are provided together with results from a selection of experiments detailing the effects of different tunings of the network. Finally, the proposed model is compared with SegNet-basic, and a near-optimal tuning of the network is compared to a selection of other state-of-art iris segmentation algorithms. The results show very promising performance from the optimized Deep Neural Networks design when compared with state-of-art techniques applied to the same lower quality datasets.},

@article{Lee2017,
abstract = {In recent years, the iris recognition system has been gaining increasing acceptance for applications such as access control and smartphone security. When the images of the iris are obtained under unconstrained conditions, an issue of undermined quality is caused by optical and motion blur, off-angle view (the user's eyes looking somewhere else, not into the front of the camera), specular reflection (SR) and other factors. Such noisy iris images increase intra-individual variations and, as a result, reduce the accuracy of iris recognition. A typical iris recognition system requires a near-infrared (NIR) illuminator along with an NIR camera, which are larger and more expensive than fingerprint recognition equipment. Hence, many studies have proposed methods of using iris images captured by a visible light camera without the need for an additional illuminator. In this research, we propose a new recognition method for noisy iris and ocular images by using one iris and two periocular regions, based on three convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Experiments were conducted by using the noisy iris challenge evaluation-part II (NICE.II) training dataset (selected from the university of Beira iris (UBIRIS).v2 database), mobile iris challenge evaluation (MICHE) database, and institute of automation of Chinese academy of sciences (CASIA)-Iris-Distance database. As a result, the method proposed by this study outperformed previous methods.},

@article{DeMarsico2018,
abstract = {Mobile biometrics technologies are nowadays the new frontier for secure use of data and services, and are considered particularly important due to the massive use of handheld devices in the entire world. Among the biometric traits with potential to be used in mobile settings, the iris/ocular region is a natural candidate, even considering that further advances in the technology are required to meet the operational requirements of such ambitious environments. Aiming at promoting these advances, we organized the Mobile Iris Challenge Evaluation (MICHE)-I contest. This paper presents a comparison of the performance of the participant methods by various Figures of Merit (FoMs). A particular attention is devoted to the identification of the image covariates that are likely to cause a decrease in the performance levels of the compared algorithms. Among these factors, interoperability among different devices plays an important role. The methods (or parts of them) implemented by the analyzed approaches are classified into segmentation (S), which was the main target of MICHE-I, and recognition (R). The paper reports both the results observed for either S or R, and also for different recombinations (S+R) of such methods. Last but not least, we also present the results obtained by multi-classifier strategies.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel and more accurate iris segmentation framework to automatically segment iris region from the face images acquired with relaxed imaging under visible or near-infrared illumination, which provides strong feasibility for applications in surveillance, forensics and the search for missing children, etc. The proposed framework is built on a novel total-variation based formulation which uses l1 norm regularization to robustly suppress noisy texture pixels for the accurate iris localization. A series of novel and robust post processing operations are introduced to more accurately localize the limbic boundaries. Our experimental results on three publicly available databases, i.e., FRGC, UBIRIS.v2 and CASIA.v4-distance, achieve significant performance improvement in terms of iris segmentation accuracy over the state-of-the-art approaches in the literature. Besides, we have shown that using iris masks generated from the proposed approach helps to improve iris recognition performance as well. Unlike prior work, all the implementations in this paper are made publicly available to further advance research and applications in biometrics at-d-distance.},
